# Term Project Phase 0: Proposal

## Gym Workout Tracker

### What will the application do?
This application will act as a centralized hub for tracking and interpreting weightlifting and workout information. It will allow users to schedule their workouts on a calendar, estimate their workout duration, track personal records *(PRs)*, and visualize their progress over time. Furthermore, by categorizing workout types *(i.e. dumbbells, barbells, cardio)*, users will be able to analyze the physical balance of their workout routines. The purpose and aim of this tool is to help anyone looking to structure and optimize their gym sessions through better organization and revealed insight.

### Who will use it? 
The application overall targets a broad range of users, from beginners to advanced-level weightlifters and fitness enthusiasts, who are looking to become stronger and healthier. It would ultimately be especially useful to individuals who thrive on visual aids and detailed, informative statistics to fine-tune their workout routines, monitor their longer-term progress, and maintain a balanced fitness regimen.

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I have been weightlifting for a few months and have been looking for a systematic way to consistently remember, keep track of, and employ progressive overload. With this app allowing me to better monitor gains or trends in both weightlifting reps and weight, I can ensure I appropriately introduce progressive load and balance growth across muscle groups. I'm also a visual learner, so having perhaps visual diagrams, charts, and numerical data helps me see at a glance how I'm progressing from a different, tangible perspective. Most importantly, rather than having to store all workout details in my head, this project will let me organize every aspect of my gym routine and both see and access my areas for improvement more clearly and effectively.

## User Stories
### As a user, I want to:
- **Create** exercises by specifying their name, equipment, target muscle groups, along with their default sets, reps, weights *(for strength training)* or duration and intervals *(for cardio)*, **so that** I can build a personalized exercise library.
- **Add** exercises from my library to a workout, **so that** I can swiftly assemble customized workouts that match and represent my current fitness level.
- **Estimate** total workout times based on exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods, **so that** I can plan or adjust my gym plan around other commitments.
- **Assign** workouts to calendar dates and view my upcoming plan, **so that** I can maintain consistency in my training regimen.
- **Modify** exercise parameters *(i.e. weight)* or reschedule/delete sessions, **so that** my gym calendar stays accurate when my plans change.
- **Log** and update my weights/reps for exercises, **so that** I can more objectively measure and introduce adequate progressive overload in my training.
- **See** projected PRs for exercises over 1-6 months using current weight/reps interpolation and linear regression of historical data, **so that** I can objectively measure abstracted strength progress.
- **See** time and volume spent per workout type *(dumbbells, cardio, etc.)*, **so that** I can balance my routine between strength and conditioning.
- **Visualize** training volume *(sets, reps)* per muscle group/region **so that** I can correct training imbalances and avoid overtraining.
